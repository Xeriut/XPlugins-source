# Setup

To make the rune dragon plugin work, you also need to import `https://github.com/illumineawake/illu-plugins` to your IDE project. You can follow his guide for that `https://github.com/illumineawake/illu-plugins/wiki/Adding-Illumine-repo-to-IntelliJ`

## Why?

Decided to open source this because of falsy being accused of being `https://github.com/Anarchise`
